Code Review Checklist Client: leading tech firm USA Industry Type: & Consulting Products & Services: Solutions, Software Development Organization Size: 100+ AWS Lambda, powerful serverless compute service, faces limitations terms runtime customization, dependency management, execution environment isolation. overcome challenges mentioned above, propose comprehensive solution involves Dockerizing AWS Lambda functions improved flexibility, control, efficiency serverless architecture. high-level architecture diagram: Key Components: key deliverables: Dockerfile: Dockerfile root Lambda function project, instructions build Docker image. file includes base image, installation dependencies, copying Lambda function code, setting handler function. Docker Image: Docker image built Dockerfile. image encapsulates Lambda function code dependencies. Pushed Image ECR: Docker image pushed Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository. involves tagging image ECR repository URI pushing repository. Updated Lambda Function Configuration: Lambda function configuration updated Docker image ECR. involve ECR URI Lambda configuration. Documentation: Documentation outlining steps Dockerize Lambda function push ECR. documentation include prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, additional considerations. Challenge: AWS Lambda imposes constraints runtime dependencies, making challenging manage control library versions. Challenge: AWS Lambda’s managed environment lack runtime configurations isolation. Challenge: Efficiently capturing analyzing performance metrics logs Dockerized Lambda functions. Solution: containerization approach package dependencies Lambda function, providing control isolation. Implement robust dependency management system Docker container. Solution: Docker containers offer enhanced isolation. Utilize containers encapsulate Lambda function dependencies, ensuring consistent execution environments. Solution: Integrate AWS CloudWatch basic monitoring.
